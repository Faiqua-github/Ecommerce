### E-commerce Data Analysis with MySQL & Python

This project showcases a complete data analysis workflow for an e-commerce dataset, starting with data ingestion — where raw CSV files are automatically read, cleaned, and loaded into a MySQL database — and continuing through data exploration and transformation using SQL queries and Python’s data analysis libraries. It culminates in insightful visualizations that reveal patterns in customer behavior, sales trends, product performance, and payment preferences. The process mirrors a real-world data analytics pipeline, combining database management with analytical programming to turn raw transactional data into actionable business insights.
