### E-commerce Data Analysis with MySQL & Python

This project showcases a complete data analysis workflow for an e-commerce dataset, starting with data ingestion â€” where raw CSV files are automatically read, cleaned, and loaded into a MySQL database â€” and continuing through data exploration and transformation using SQL queries and Pythonâ€™s data analysis libraries. It culminates in insightful visualizations that reveal patterns in customer behavior, sales trends, product performance, and payment preferences. The process mirrors a real-world data analytics pipeline, combining database management with analytical programming to turn raw transactional data into actionable business insights.

### Libruaries Used

## ðŸ“Œ Project Workflow

1. **Data Collection**

   * Multiple CSV files (`customers.csv`, `orders.csv`, `products.csv`, etc.) containing e-commerce transaction data are prepared.

2. **Data Ingestion into MySQL**

   * Python script automatically reads each CSV file.
   * Cleans column names (replaces spaces, dashes, and dots with underscores).
   * Infers correct MySQL data types (INT, FLOAT, DATETIME, etc.).
   * Creates tables dynamically if they donâ€™t exist.
   * Inserts cleaned data into MySQL tables.

3. **Data Exploration (SQL Queries)**

   * Retrieve and analyze:

     * Unique customer cities.
     * Yearly and monthly order counts.
     * Total sales per category.
     * Payment installment percentages.
     * Customer distribution by state.

4. **Data Analysis with Python**

   * Use **Pandas** for data manipulation and aggregation.
   * Use **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for statistical plotting.

5. **Visualization & Insights**

   * Generate bar charts, pie charts, and line plots to visualize:

     * Sales trends over time.
     * Best-selling categories.
     * Geographic distribution of customers.
     * Payment method preferences.

6. **Conclusion & Business Insights**

   * Summarize findings to highlight key business opportunities and operational improvements.
